# PvP All Day RESTful API on Laravel 5.3

PvP All Day is a Massive Video Warehouse where gamers alike can come to view, submit, and rate the top videos in the Gaming Community!

This project is the revamped, fully mobile friendly, cleaner coded, vastly more dynamic and modular version of the new Website.

_Currently a Work in Progress..._

PvP All Day was founded to showcase the videos that players should see. To avoid gamers needing to sift through YouTube or Twitch highlights to find the amazing videos they are looking for and should be seeing.

**Founded On:** September 24th, 2012 - _We have come so far._

**Founded and Created By:** Vinlock [http://www.twitter.com/Vinlockz]()

> "After seeing the first few PvP Videos released by some of the Aion Community back in 1.5 I instantly fell in love with the creativity that was possible in videos for Aion. The PvP Video Intros, the credits, the filters, the action, the skill, the excitement, the teamwork, and everything else stood out to me so much. I created PvP All Day to give these people a channel to tune to specifically for Aion Online videos that were created by amazing people and players alike, to showcase their creativity and skill all in one place." - Vinlock
